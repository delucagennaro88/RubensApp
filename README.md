# RubensApp
A simple one-page Android App, made for the Google Android Basics Scholarship 2017.

I’ve created a little hommage to my favourite painter, Rubens.
It has a very simple structure. I am a beginner and I would rather stay comfortable than risk something new. It is made by a background with a detail from a painting (ImageView), the name of the artist as a signature (fake TextView, it’s a ImageView), his birth and death dates (TextView).
1) I took the background from the library of Europeana, among the pictures with free licence. It’s the painting with Daniel in the Lions’ Den (from the National Gallery in Washington). I’v cut the pic in order to work with a more significant detail. The ImageView is extended for the whole surface of the background.
2) I took the Rubens’ signature from the web. In order to use it, I edited the pic, deleting the background . The ImageView is Set to a fixed size and located on the top of the screen. Now the Fake TextView is ready and looks like coming out from the mouth of the lyon! 
3) At last the TextView with the dates of birth and death of Rubens. They’re positioned below the signature.
The App is ready. That’s all folks! 
My Pc is too old and rebel to manage a video editor, so I created a slideshow: https://www.slideshare.net/gennarodeluca1/rubens-app
